## Business problems solved with AI Builder Language detection

Use Cases

-   Optimize the customer support process

    -   Automatically route customer feedback to agents with the correct language skill.
        -   `Example:`
            Incoming customer feedback from digital forms or emails can be sent to AI Builder to detect the language. After AI Builder has detected the language, the customer feedback is routed to the correct set of agents who are proficient in that language. The agent gets the customer feedback and takes the appropriate next steps. The detection of language and automated routing saves human intervention and time to route the ticket appropriately.

-   Provide content in the right language to the customer

    -   Provide information to customers, localized in the language that was used in the question.
    -   `Example:`
        The customer enters a question on the Contoso Airlines power app in French. The power app uses AI Builder to detect the language, which then provides the user with the answer in French from their localized content stores.

-   Save extracted information in the best location for processing
    -   Agents take pictures of paper forms that contain records. The language is detected and the information is automatically entered into Microsoft Dynamics CRM.
    -   `Example:`
        A public company is auditing pharmacies. The auditors are going on site and will be using a paper form to record results. Afterward, an agent manually enters the results in CRM. The agent takes a picture of each audit record and saves it to a folder. A flow will process all new pictures in the folders and then send them to AI Builder to extract the audited notes. Then, AI Builder will detect the language and save them to the correct location in CRM.

        Now, you have insight into some of the many business scenarios that could be enhanced with help from AI Builder language detection.
