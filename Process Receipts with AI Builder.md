## Process Receipts with AI Builder

-   The prebuilt AI model uses state-of-the-art optical character recognition (OCR) to extract printed and handwritten text from receipts. You can retrieve valuable information such as merchant details, transaction date and time, a list of purchased items, tax, and totals.
-   Only English receipts from the United States are currently supported.
-   Full page receipts, such as hotel receipts or invoices, are not supported.
-   For best results, limit your photos to only one receipt for each image and take the photo in adequate lighting conditions.

## Solve business problems with receipt processing

-   Travel and expense (T&E) <br><br>
    Travel and expense (T&E) can represent a significant operational cost for businesses. Managing these expenses can also be difficult because it requires considerable manual work and leaves room for potential user error. By uploading a receipt, you can extract the data from the receipt and instantly fill out the line items in expense reports. Furthermore, you can automate the entire extraction process, scanning receipts as they are added to a central location, and match them with credit card transactions.<br><br>
-   Accounting and auditing <br><br>
    Expense management is equally as important for large and small companies. Small business accounting, even your own personal accounting, can be streamlined by prepopulating expense reports with key information that is extracted from receipts. Then, when it's time for audits or reimbursement claims, you can assist auditors directly by using the receipt values or help them detect for anomalies or fraud.
